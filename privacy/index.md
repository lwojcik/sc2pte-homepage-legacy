# Privacy Policy

**Last update: 2018-12-01**

We are Lukem.net. We build interactive applications for web and mobile devices.

StarCraft II Profile Twitch Extension (“SC2PTE” or "Extension") needs a small chunk of your data to calculate and present your StarCraft II statistics to your viewers. We aim to make this process as transparent as possible. This privacy policy is meant to explain what happens when you interact with the extension.

SC2PTE operates on Twitch.tv. By using it you are subject to Twitch.tv Terms of Service.

## What information is collected?

To operate properly, we have to identify you as a Twitch channel owner and locate your StarCraft II profile in order to fetch your statistics. To do so, we use the following information:

1. Information you provide us when you submit the configuration:
   1. Your StarCraft II player profile credentials:
      1. region identifier as single digit number (1 for Americas, 2 for Europe, 3 for Korea, 5 for China),

1. Information we receive from third parties:
   1. Your Twitch user ID (sometimes called channel ID)
   1. Your Twitch channel role:
      1. When you configure the extension in your channel, we identify you as ‘broadcaster’,
      1. On Twitch channels which use the extension but don’t belong to you, we identify you as ‘viewer’,

If you contact us via email or other communication channel, we keep the record of your message and your contact credentials so that we can reply to you.

## How do we use your information?

### Connect to Blizzard API

We use your StarCraft II profile credentials to:

1. Confirm their validity against Blizzard API,
1. Obtain your StarCraft II season statistics.

### Storing configuration data

We use your Twitch ID and your channel role to:

1. Identify you as an owner of a Twitch channel on which you install the extension and enable relevant configuration capabilities based on that,
1. Ensure the capabilities mentioned above are not available to unauthorized parties,
1. Save and store your extension configuration settings in our database,
1. Enable easy retrieval and modification process of your configuration settings,
1. Periodically update your StarCraft II statistics in the extension panel.

### Fetching data from Blizzard API

   1. Your in-game name,
   1. Your clan membership,

   1. Cumulative statistics for each ranked mode (1v1, archon, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4):
      1. Number of wins,
      1. Number of losses,
      1. Top MMR,

### Caching your StarCraft II statistics

Your StarCraft II statistics are automatically cached on our backend for a limited period of time to keep the server performance at optimal level.

### Server logs

Throughout the whole extension lifecycle (saving and fetching the configuration data, viewing the extension) we store basic activity logs on our extension backend server. Those logs include date and time of the request, requested URL, response code, user agent string and error information. Processing those information is necessary in order to prevent abuse, unauthorized system access and ensuring the safety of the data. The logs are automatically deleted after 30 days.

### Local Storage

The extension uses browser’s Local Storage function to cache your StarCraft II statistics on user devices. That ensures the extension keeps showing the most recent data available in case of service malfunction.

## Do we disclose your information to outside parties?

Some of your information is disclosed to our trusted third parties who help us operate the extension. Those parties include our hosting and database providers, load balancing service providers etc.

We may release your information when it’s necessary to comply with the law.

## Safeguards

We use SSL (HTTPS) to encrypt data exchange between your web browser and the extension service.

The extension backend service uses variety of security measures to ensure the safety of your information when you access it.

Both the extension frontend and the extension backend service are constantly monitored for possible vulnerabilities and intrusions.

## Can I delete my information?

When you disable or uninstall the extension, your data are not deleted automatically.

You can request deletion of your data by sending an email to lukemsc@lukem.net.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Please check this page periodically for updates.

In case of changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you in the extension itself. If you continue to use the extension after the changes, you indicate your agreement to those changes.
